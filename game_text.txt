Question 009:
Q: Which type of interest rate would you like to go with for your savings? Below are the equations and explanations of each type of interest:
You have a balance: B which is invested for a number of years, call this number n, and you have a fixed yearly rate of interest, call this r. To work out how much money you gain you replace the letters B, n and r with the actual values!

Compounded annually : B * (1 + r/100) ^ n (for example investing £100 for 1 year at a yearly rate of 10% interest, at the end you get £110 = 100 + (10% of 100) = 100*1 + 100*10/100 = 100(1+10/100) = B*(1+r/100)
Compounded m times per year: B * (1 + r/(100m)) ^ nm (for example investing £100 for 1 year at a yearly rate of 10% interest 4 times per year (so every 3 months) after 3 months you get:
  £102.50 = 100 + (10%/4 of 100) = 100*1 + 100*0.025 = 100(1+0.025) = B*(1+r/4)^4 and at the end you get £110.38

A1: Compounded annually (interest is calculated and added to your account once each year)

Question 010: # STILL WORKING THIS OUT
Q: Which pension plan would you like to go for?
A Defined Benefit pension scheme, often referred to as a 'final salary' scheme, provides a specific level of income at retirement determined by salary and length of service, offering certainty about future income.
Defined Contribution schemes rely on contributions and investment returns, with retirement income depending on investment performance, posing individual risk rather than employer guarantee.
