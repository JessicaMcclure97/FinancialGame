Question 009:
Q: Which type of interest rate would you like to go with? Below are the equations and explanations of each type of interest:
You have a balance: B which is invested for a number of years, call this number n, and you have a fixed yearly rate of interest, call this r. To work out how much money you gain you replace the letters B, n and r with the actual values!

Compounded annually : B * (1 + r/100) ^ n (for example investing £100 for 1 year at a yearly rate of 10% interest, at the end you get £110 = 100 + (10% of 100) = 100*1 + 100*10/100 = 100(1+10/100) = B*(1+r/100)
Compounded m times per year: B * (1 + r/(100m)) ^ nm (for example investing £100 for 1 year at a yearly rate of 10% interest 4 times per year (so every 3 months) after 3 months you get:
  £102.50 = 100 + (10%/4 of 100) = 100*1 + 100*0.025 = 100(1+0.025) = B*(1+r/4)^4 and at the end you get £110.38

A1: Compounded annually (interest is calculated and added to your account once each year)
